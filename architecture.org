#+TITLE: Architectural Roadmap

An overview of the intended feature set of the =wakari.el= spaced
repetition system. This serves as both a planning document and a
request-for-comment.

* TODO Application Entry Point

The user should be able to access the following =wakari= functionality
from anywhere in Emacs:

- Begin a review session of all due items
- Begin a review session of filtered items
- View stats for the entire =wakari= collection
- View stats for a filtered subset of the =wakari= collection

Given the potential value of various flags (e.g. selecting an
algorithm on the fly, doing a review session against a one-off filter,
overriding item-per-day caps), consider having a single =wakari=
function that drops the user into a transient menu.

* TODO Review Session Logic

* TODO Item Indexing

* TODO Index Persistence

* TODO Item Templating

* TODO Tool Invocation Support

* TODO Multiple Algorithm Support
