Wakari provides a highly customizable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][spaced repetition]] (henceforth
"SR") system for knowledge retention and skill cultivation. It aims to
address the limitations of existing SR systems for complex skill
development by rejecting the strict flashcard paradigm and allowing
the user to integrate arbitrary tools into their practice.

Due to the current nascence of the project, this document and the
architectural roadmap currently serve as documents of intent and
requests for comment.

* Premise

Existing SR systems center on a flashcard model with varying degrees
of support for non-interactive media such as images, audio, and
video. If the system recognizes relationships between cards, this is
generally limited to the 'sibling' model. The user must manually make
all modifications to the collection of items under study at such time
as is appropriate. While within this paradigm a regular SR practice can
greatly improve a user's memory retention, it suffers from the
following limitations:

1. The lack of integration with other software tools limits the user's
   ability to simulate the experience of tasks associated with them,
   reducing the fidelity of the cultivated memory. The user may work
   around this by writing prompts instructing them to perform such and
   such an action and guess or observe the results, but this
   introduces unnecessary friction.
2. The lack of a robust relationship model between knowledge items
   limit's the user's progression to item-by-item tracking; concepts
   like prerequisites, obsoletion, sequencing, or even simple
   randomization are not supported. Again, there are ways the user can
   work around these limitations, but such methods are manual,
   tedious, and require disruption of existing study sessions or
   frequent backtracking during other item creation in order to be
   timely.
3. Taken together, issues 1 and 2 make the decomposition of complex
   tasks into smaller chunks in a smooth study flow considerably more
   difficult, leading many users to forego the potential benefits of
   SR in 'skill' acquisition in the belief that SR is only good for
   memorizing small chunks of information.
4. Excepting previous Emacs-based SR efforts, other SR systems even
   limit the potential of purely text-based items by compelling the
   use of very limited text editors.

By way of solution, Wakari aims to offer the following:

1. Integration with arbitrary tooling. Emacs already offers various
   means for the user to interact with any other tool on your
   computerâ€”or indeed, on any computer to which you have
   access. Wakari will provide hooks that allow for code execution at
   each point of a knowledge item's life cycle, or in the event the
   user wants a focused session that will make heavy use of one
   particular tool, hooks that allow for code execution at each point
   of a review session's life cycle.
2. A greatly expanded set of relationships between knowledge items,
   coupled with a framework for extending relationships or creating
   new ones. Out of the box, Wakari aims to support:

   - Siblings
   - Prerequisites
   - Rotations
   - Obsoletions
   - Sequences

   Beyond that, Wakari will also aim to make it easy for users to
   define custom relationship behavior to suit their needs.
3. Extremely powerful text-editing, though it gets that for free by
   dint of living in Emacs.
